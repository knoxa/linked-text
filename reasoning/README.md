# Reasoning over text

Structured knowledge may be derived from, or justified by, unstructured text; but there is a lot of uncertainty. Individual sources might be mistaken (or lying), and the 'fact extraction' processes that build knowledge structures will make mistakes. The idea here is to consider fact extraction processes as making claims, and look for confirmation or contradiction across multiple sources.
