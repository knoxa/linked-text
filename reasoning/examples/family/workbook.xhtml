<h1>An example of fact extraction as dialogue</h1>

<p class="note">
This example attempts to construct the Julio-Claudian family tree.
</p>
<p class="note">We derive arguments from historical source text. We quote extracts from the text and use them as evidence to support claims.
We present all this in a 'workbook' style. This needs to be human readable, but have sufficient structure for it to be possible (ideally simple) to extract an AIF argument map. The idea is that the process of developing knowledge (by elaborating the arguments) is iterative: the 'workbook' can be updated/extended an re-evaluated repeatedly. 
This document is an example of such a workbook. Sections with coloured backgrounds represent dialogue, with different colours representing different agents (human or machine). The rest is narrative to expound the process.
</p>

<p class="note">
The aim is to construct very simple arguments as might reasonably be produced by natural language processing. These will be about entities and relationships. They are justified by the source text. They may or may not be correct. They can be rebutted or confirmed (or questioned) by other agents 'reading' the same text.

	<p class="note">At this stage, we're identifying entities by the names expressed in the text. This is fine in the context of this single source reference, but is likely to be a problem when we try to relate entities across a number of source references.</p>

	<p class="note">If we later run into problems resolving the above entities, we can come back and add more claims. For example, after we've processed the next source reference below we'll see that there are at least three different Julias; so we might come back and add: </p>

	<div class="analysis">
		<p class="rewrite">"Julia" refers to <span class="name">Julia Minor</span>.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="note">... and later still, we'll find that we want to 'tidy up' the Octavia references:</p>

	<div class="analysis">
		<p class="rewrite">"Octavia the younger" refers <span class="name">Octavia the Younger</span>.</p>
		<p class="rewrite">"the elder Octavia" refers to <span class="name">Octavia the Elder</span>.</p>

	<p class="note">These claims let us rewrite the earlier entity relationship arguments. The result is:</p>

</article>

<p class="note">The argument maps so far have no conflicts. We can assume the claims they make are facts and try to build some data structure, such as a family tree.</p>

<p class="note">We can take the claims of familial relationships, rewritten or not, and make a graph of people linked parent to child. The results can be analysed to check
the facts. For example, there's something wrong if the graph is not a tree, or if a child node has more than two parents. So far, the family tree has the same structure whether claims are rewritten or not.
The result (rewritten) is C.</p>

<p class="note">Now it does make a significant difference whether we construct a family tree from raw or rewritten claims. In the former case we'll get cycles: Julia and Agrippa each link to themselves, and
the Julia in this quote is treated as the same Julia as above (Suet. Aug. 4), which creates a cycle in the graph. Rewriting sorts this out, and gives:</p>

<img class="medium" src="family-a.svg" alt="family tree, extended" />

<p class="note">The nodes labelled with question marks come from the grandparent relationship and indicate an unknown intermediate between grandparent and grandchild. It's clear from the 
graph that Augustus is either the father of Marcus Agrippa or Julia the elder, but we haven't established which yet. Once we have, these nodes become redundant and can be deleted.</p>

<p class="note">
We can ask a question ...
</p>

<div class="analysis" about="urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo012.perseus-eng1:62">
	<p class="question">Is Augustus the father of Marcus Agrippa, or of Julia the Elder?</p>
</div>

<p class="note">
This becomes part of the <strong>dialogue</strong>, but doesn't necessarily become part of the <strong>argument</strong>. It can if you want it to though. For example,
we can argue that we're not prepared to believe any of the claims derived from the source quote until all questions about it have been answered.
