A state is a property or relationship that pertains to an entity for an interval of time.


There are usually rules that make states valid or not. For example, over time, a battalion may belong to any number of brigades, but it should only belong to one brigade at any given instant of time.


Membership of a brigade is a state of the battalion. 

We can construct a partial order of states and use it to assess and validate knowledge.
If we have full knowledge of how a particular battalion transferred between brigades, then the partial order of these states ought to be a chain. If it isn't, then we've something wrong.
If our knowledge is partial then we aren't going to get a chain of states, but partial order shows where the gaps in our knowledge are.

Other information will corroborate or conflict with our model. For example, we might have brigade and divisional movements. You would expect a division and its
component units to be in the same region.


We'll call a partial order of events or states, where each item concerns the same concrete entity, a *history*. Histories intertwine where entities form relationships.

We can construct a partial order of states of some specific type, such as membership of an organization. We don't expect this to be chain.


----

We may have a vague state such as "during the First World War", and a more specific state giving dates.

A more specific claim corroborates a more general one. Do we disambiguate?

The existence of an entity is a state. Will have a beginning and end that should be consistent with a state they are part of.

A relationship between entities is a state that exists for a period of time.

We can't expect complete information about the periods of time.
We might know that the state is true at some specific instant, but not when it started or ended.
We might know when the state started but not when it ended (or vice versa).
We might know that the state is after (or before) some particular event, without knowing exactly when the event happened.
We might know that the state exists during some interval of time.

## Formations

An ies:State acts as the proxy for an entity that takes part in a temporary relationship. If I claim:

	Unit A is part of Unit X.
  
then this is a state of Unit A. The state is "part of" Unit X.

	Units A and B are part of Unit X.
	
This is a state of Unit X. Units A and B are "part of" the state.

I can add a clause to the state giving some information about the time span:

	Unit A was part of Unit X between one date and another.
	
The time span is associated with the state.
