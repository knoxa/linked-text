The knowledge base is natural language text.

Reasoning over knowledge requires creating and manipulating models of the knowledge.

Manipulating models might involve making complex models from simpler ones.

Reasoning over knowledge models depends on the structure of those models. They tend to be designed to support the particular line of reasoning.
Other questions or considerations that arise might not be easily answerable with an existing model.

We can interpret natural language and construct a model directly.

We can have natural language text and derive models from natural language processing.

We can encode the model as semantic mark-up of natural language.

We can use semantic mark-up to give some structure to the natural language text that might enable either natural language processing or direct modelling.

We might use natural language processing of text to embellish it with semantic mark-up to it.

We need models for precision. The richer a model, the more complex it is to construct and manipulate, the more likely mistakes will be made in constructing it.
Available information might not make it as far as the model if the model is complicated and difficult to understand, or the information comes
from a loose collaborative team effort whose member don't necessarily have the requisite skills, or don't have the time or inclination to acquire them.

We might need complex models, but we should try and construct them from simple components.
Rather than trying to get there in one step, we should arrange things so that encoding raw knowledge should be done in
terms of simple models that are easy to understand and quick to learn. More complex models can then be composed from these simple ones. It might be that
creating the complex models requires knowledge not encoded in the simpler models. In this case, the model building process should "ask questions".

The process from the point-of-view of a subject matter expert, who is presumably not an ontologist, should be one of stating facts as text or perhaps
completing simple forms. Then later making clarifications or answering questions as directed by the processing of the information.
The process should not be a waterfall. There should always be some way of representing the information captured in the final model to the SME for verification and validation.
